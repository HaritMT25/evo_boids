// Match distance — distance between two Genomes in the SAME folded
// (source, sink) connectivity space that buildNeuralNet() wires, and that the
// species SimHash (stats.hpp) and genome colour (genome_color.hpp) already
// share via connectivity.hpp. Duplicate edges sum, exactly as they do in the
// net's accumulators.
//
// WHY NOT genomeSimilarity() (genome.hpp): it compares gene i to gene i, and
// only sourceType/sinkType — two bits per gene, positionally aligned.
// mutateGenome inserts, deletes and duplicates genes, so a SINGLE indel shifts
// every downstream gene and collapses the score between a Genome and a Genome
// derived directly from it. That is tolerable for the rough percept it feeds
// (GENETIC_SIM_NEAREST) and useless as an admission gate. The fold below is
// permutation-invariant and indel-robust, which is precisely what a gate needs.
// core_tests pins the contrast directly, so the reason this function exists
// stays documented in the test suite rather than only here.
//
// DETERMINISM. This is sim-path code, so it obeys the project's rules:
//   * no rng draws, ever — the gate must not perturb the draw sequence;
//   * no transcendentals, so no evomath:: dependency — only +, -, *, and an
//     exact power-of-two divide (weight / 8192.0f, the same expression
//     Gene::weightAsFloat() uses, so folded weights are bit-identical to the
//     ones stats.hpp and genome_color.hpp compute);
//   * no heap allocation;
//   * the result is independent of the sort ALGORITHM, so libstdc++ and
//     libc++/wasm agree bit for bit. See the ordering note on cellWeightLess().

// the live window is (T and W are read off a 0.5-step spinner and the whole
// scale sits below 32, where quarters are exact). When it is not, fl(T + W)

// arithmetic, so native and wasm agree on it bit for bit), it needs d to equal
// T to the last bit, and it is why the rails are stated against the fold's
// resolution rather than as absolutes.
//
// DETERMINISM. Pure math: the caller supplies u, so this function draws
// NOTHING and does not violate this file's no-rng contract — the single
// rng.unit() per gate evaluation lives at the call site in world.hpp, where
// the draw discipline can be read next to the branch it feeds. No division and
// no transcendental: only +, -, * and a compare, all IEEE-exact and therefore
// bit-identical between native and wasm.
