// OceanWorld — the 3-D preview world (PLAN_ocean_preview.md). Serial only.
//
// Adapted from Classic's World (src/core/world.hpp) with the thread paths and
// the profiler dropped. (x, y) is Classic's wrapping plane, unchanged; depth is
// a third coordinate in [0, D], clamped (0 = surface). Everything that does not
// depend on geometry is the kernel's (kernel.hpp) and WorldCommon's, called the
// way World calls it; what is here is what depth changes:
//
//   * fish move horizontally exactly as Classic's creatures (OceanConfig::
//     steerFrame 1 turns STEER_X / STEER_Y into the fish's own frame: right,
//     ahead), then vertically:
//       vz += steerZ·3·dt + kBuoy·(bodyBuoy·D − depth)/D·dt (+ MOVE_RANDOM's
//       third draw, + a soft push inside wallBand of surface / floor);
//       vz −= vz·vDrag·dt; |vz| ≤ pitchMax; depth += vz·speed·dt
//   * depth costs (OceanConfig cHold / cPress) after kernel::stepMetabolism
//   * optional food lifetime (OceanConfig::foodLife): uneaten food is removed
//     foodLife seconds after it appeared
//   * eating, interaction, sensing and the predators' capture use 3-D
//     distance: the SpatialGrid is still on (x, y), its candidates are
//     filtered by 3-D distance (a shallow sea: candidates per query stay
//     close to Classic's)
//   * five more sensors (LOC_Z, OWN_VEL_Z, NEAREST_FOOD_DZ, AVG_NEIGHBOR_DZ,
//     BOUNDARY_DIST_Z) and one more action (STEER_Z)
//   * predators (Stage A, and the Stage B economy as Classic has it) chase in
//     depth; a child predator buds at its parent's depth ± 8
//   * bodyBuoy: founders are neutral where they are dropped (depth / D);
//     a child gets its parents' mean + one U(±buoyMutation) draw, after
//     kernel::inheritFromPair; a child starts at its parents' midpoint depth
//
// Reused unchanged: SignalGrid (a column: the pheromone layer has no depth),
// CurrentField (horizontal), SpatialGrid, Predator (+ depth, pitch).
//
// E1 physics (OceanConfig, every knob OFF by default; OFF = the preview's
// arithmetic, bit for bit — each old block is kept as the fallback branch):
//   * flowAt(p, d): a 3-D, divergence-free flow = the current (× f(d) =
//     smoothstep(2d/D) when deepCurrent) + three tapered deep-water wave
//     trains (waveSpeed > 0). It replaces the horizontal current wherever
//     flowE1(): food (with foodDrift), predators and fish move by dt·U after
//     their own motion, a fish by min(1, 1/bodySize)·dt·U with sizeDrift;
//     depth is clamped after, x / y wrap. CURRENT_FWD / LR read flowAt.
//     While flowE1() it is evaluated from a derived cache (ocean_flow.hpp).
//   * lightAt(d) = L0·exp(−kWater·d) (oceanmath::expf, ocean_math.hpp):
//     display only (the page's shading); not part of the state.
//   * depthCostScaled: cHold / cPress as multiples of metabolicRate·massFactor.
//   * sizeFight: kernel::fightOutcome's strengths × bodySize²; mouthGate:
//     food (OceanFood::size, 1 for now) only if size <= kMouth·bodySize, for
//     eating and for the smell sensors alike.
// No E1 feature draws from the rng.
//
// The compound eye (build variant -DEVO_OCEAN_EYE, switched by OceanConfig::eye;
// PLAN_fish_patterns §7). One general sense: every object within the
// perception radius R — fish, food, predators — is binned by the dominant
// axis of its offset in the fish's LEVEL frame (forward = the horizontal
// heading, right = its perpendicular, down = depth) into six sectors: ahead,
// behind, left, right, up, down. Per sector, the NEAREST object gives three
// inputs (18 sensors, EYE_*):
//     PROX = 1 − d/R
//     SIZE = s / (s + d)       apparent size s/d, squashed to [0, 1)
//     CON  = b − L(z)          brightness against the ambient light at the
//                              object's depth, L(z) = exp(−kEyeWater·z)
// Objects differ only in (s, b): food glows (small, b = 1), predators are
// dark and large (b = 0.05), fish are b = 0.5 and s = bodySize x the body
// length (a placeholder until patterns give fish an appearance). The eye is
// computed inside the existing neighbour, food and predator loops — no extra
// queries — and draws no random numbers. Off (or in the plain Ocean build)
// the 18 inputs read 0, the same as six empty sectors.
//
// Why LEVEL (the fish's pitch is ignored, deliberately): a fish has no pitched
// body to look out of. It swims along a horizontal unit heading (Fish::vel) at
// `speed` and changes depth through a separate rate (vz; depth += vz·speed·dt;
// its drawn pitch is atan(vz)), and its motor commands act in that same level
// frame: STEER_X / STEER_Y (steerFrame 1: right / ahead of the horizontal
// heading) and STEER_Z (down). A level eye reports every offset in exactly the
// frame the fish can act in — ahead / behind / left / right against the
// heading and STEER_X, up / down against STEER_Z — whatever vz is at the
// moment. A pitched eye would tilt "ahead" into depth by atan(vz) (27° at the
// default pitchMax 0.5, 76° at pitchMax 4) and give "up" a different motor
// meaning at every pitch.
//
// What the eye sees within one step (the rule every labeled sense follows too,
// and Classic's World): fish are stepped in index order, each sensing and then
// moving, while the spatial grid holds every fish's START-of-step (x, y).
// Candidates are the grid's: the stored positions within R in (x, y) of the
// viewer's own start-of-step position (it senses before it moves). The eye
// then takes each candidate's offset from hot_, which a fish rewrites as soon
// as it has moved (with its new depth's contrast). So for viewer j:
//   * a fish i > j (not stepped yet) is seen exactly where it starts the step;
//   * a fish i < j (already stepped) is seen at its MOVED position, but only if
//     its start-of-step (x, y) was within R too: one that swam into range this
//     step is first seen next step (it is within one step's travel, maxSpeed·dt
//     plus the current, of the edge of R), and one that swam out is dropped by
//     the 3-D test on the moved offset (d² <= R²);
//   * food (drifted before the grid is built, eaten only after the per-fish
//     phase) and predators (a linear scan; they move after the per-fish phase)
//     are seen exactly where they are, with this step's contrast.
// Every binned object is within R of the viewer in 3-D (the test is on the
// offset actually used), so PROX is in [0, 1] and SIZE in (0, 1]; the stale grid
// can only delay a fish entering the edge of R by one step, never bin an object
// outside R or index past an array (no fish is born, dies or is reordered, and
// no predator is added or removed, during the per-fish phase).
//
// Eye encodings (OceanConfig::eyeCode, a bitmask, the eye build only; 0 = the
// eye above, bit for bit). They answer three limits of the nearest-object
// code for small evolved nets: a unipolar left / right pair needs two wires of
// opposite sign to steer both ways; CON does not fade with distance (it jumps
// from b − L to 0 at R); and the nearest object hides everything behind it.
// The 18 sensor names stay; what they report:
//   bit 0 (1) faded contrast: CON = PROX x (b − L(z)), 0 at R.
//   bit 2 (4) summed sectors: each sector sums over EVERY object in it, in
//          the eye's visit order (fish, then food, then predators; float sums
//          in that order), squashed by q(x) = x / (1 + |x|):
//              PROX = q(Σ (1 − d/R)),  SIZE = q(Σ s / (s + d)),
//              CON  = q(Σ (1 − d/R)(b − L(z)))   (always faded: bit 0 adds nothing)
//          so PROX and SIZE are in [0, 1) and CON in (−1, 1); one object at
//          d gives PROX = (1 − d/R) / (2 − d/R). An empty sector reads 0.
//   bit 1 (2) opponent pairs, applied last (after bit 0 / bit 2), per feature:
//              EYE_LEFT_*  = left + right     EYE_RIGHT_* = right − left
//              EYE_UP_*    = up + down        EYE_DOWN_*  = down − up
//          (AHEAD / BEHIND unchanged). Invertible — left = (L' − R') / 2,
//          right = (L' + R') / 2 — so nothing is lost, and EYE_RIGHT_* is
//          signed: one wire from it to STEER_X can turn toward either side.
//          PROX / SIZE: the sum slots are in [0, 2], the difference slots in
//          [−1, 1]; CON in [−2, 2] in both (open intervals with bit 2).
// Every encoding sees the same objects in the same order as code 0 (no extra
// queries, no draws), so eye-only mode's bit-identity holds for each.
// Two ablation bits (the "cloaked" eye) choose which KINDS of object the eye
// bins at all — the nearest or the sum is then over the rest, so a cloaked
// kind neither shows nor hides anything behind it:
//   bit 3 (8)  the eye ignores fish (food and predators still seen)
//   bit 4 (16) the eye ignores food (fish and predators still seen)
// Predators are always seen. Only the eye is cloaked: every labeled sense
// (and the interaction vote) is unchanged, so with the labels on the loops run
// as before and only skip the eye's bin; in eye-only mode eyeScan skips the
// cloaked kind's query altogether (it feeds nothing else). Each composes with
// the encodings (e.g. 12 = summed sectors over food and predators). No draws.
//
// Eye-only mode (OceanConfig::eyeOnly, the eye build only): the 23 LABELED
// exteroceptive senses the eye replaces (ocean::kLabeledSenses) read 0 and are
// not computed:
//     food:       NEAREST_FOOD_DX/DY/DZ, NEAREST_FOOD_DIST, FOOD_DENSITY
//     predators:  PREDATOR_FWD/LR/PROX
//     neighbours: NEIGHBOR_COUNT, AVG_NEIGHBOR_DX/DY/DZ,
//                 AVG_NEIGHBOR_HEADING_X/Y, NEAREST_NEIGHBOR_DIST,
//                 POPULATION_DENSITY/FWD/LR, LONGPROBE_POP_FWD,
//                 NEAREST_NEIGHBOR_AGE/FOOD, GENETIC_SIM_NEAREST/FWD
// Kept (23): own state and proprioception (LOC_X/Y/Z, BOUNDARY_DIST_X/Y/Z,
// BOUNDARY_DIST, OWN_VEL_X/Y/Z, OWN_SPEED, LAST_MOVE_DIR_X/Y, AGE,
// FOOD_RESERVES, OSCILLATOR, RESPONSIVENESS), the non-visual senses
// (SIGNAL0/_FWD/_LR, CURRENT_FWD/LR) and RANDOM_SENSOR; plus the 18 EYE_*
// inputs when the eye is on (eye 0 + eyeOnly 1 = "blind"). The eye sees the
// same objects in the same order as with the labels on, so its 18 inputs are
// bit-identical between the two modes for the same state. The pairwise
// interaction vote (kernel::interactionVote) builds its own contact inputs and
// is unchanged. No draws are added or removed (RANDOM_SENSOR is still drawn).
//
// Build note: the eye build has 64 sensors, so genes decode with % 64 instead
// of % 46 and its colour / SimHash planes are its own (STATS_DIM 1900); that is
// a different genetics from the plain Ocean build even with the eye off, which
// is why it is a separate build and the plain one is untouched.
//
// -DEVO_OCEAN_PROF adds a phase profiler (oprof: sensor gather, feedForward,
// movement + metabolism, the grid build and the serial phase) for the eye
// benchmark (tools/ocean_eye_bench.cpp); it changes no state.
//
// E1 with the eye build's features (each keeps its own definition):
//   * the eye sees every food item within R whatever its size: mouthGate
//     gates eating and the smell sensors (NEAREST_FOOD_*, FOOD_DENSITY), not
//     sight;
//   * a food item's eyeCon (the contrast the eye sees) is set at spawn and
//     set again whenever the E1 flow moves the item in depth (foodDrift), so
//     it is always eyeContrast(food glow, its depth) — without E1 food never
//     changes depth, so the set at spawn is the only one;
//   * a fish's look (hot_ eyeSize / eyeCon) is refreshed after it has moved,
//     flow drift included; predators' contrast is taken before the per-fish
//     phase (they move, and drift, after it);
//   * foodLife ages food after this step's drift and before the spawn, and
//     the spawn cap (targetFood·2) counts the LIVE items: what expired this
//     step frees its place in the same step's spawn, not only after the
//     end-of-step erase;
//   * CURRENT_FWD / LR (kept in eye-only mode) read the 3-D flow under E1;
//   * steerFrame turns STEER_X / STEER_Y before the flow drift is added.
//
// Glass walls (OceanConfig::walls, OFF by default — off, every result is the
// one before the key existed; on, toroidal is off: the senses and queries do
// not wrap, and nothing else does either). On:
//   * the side faces x = 0, W and y = 0, H are glass. A fish's or predator's
//     heading, once chosen (the same actions and draws), turns away inside
//     sideWallBand of a face (wallAvoid: a bounded rotation toward the inward
//     normal, sideWallTurnRate x the band depth rad/s); after swimming it is
//     clamped at contact with the outward heading component reflected (speed
//     kept), then carried by the wall flow, then contained again (the depth
//     faces' outward pitch removed); lastMoveDir, hot_ and the body trail
//     (held inside) follow the resolved result.
//   * the flow is the wall-compatible one (the "glass walls" evaluators: each
//     wave train a quadrature pair of Neumann standing modes, the current a
//     streamfunction tapered to zero at the side faces): divergence-free, no
//     flow through any of the six faces; every reader (food, fish, predators,
//     CURRENT_FWD / LR, the harness) gets it.
//   * food rides it with deterministic midpoint substeps (as many as the
//     flow's speed and scale need, up to 16; beyond, food lags water too fast
//     for it: wallFoodSteps, wallAdvect), every excursion
//     mirror-folded (never projected onto the glass); patch food
//     is drawn over the patch ∩ the tank (one draw per coordinate, as open);
//     a predator's bud is mirror-folded into the tank (the same draws).
// No wall step draws from the rng.
//
// The appearance genome (OceanConfig::appearance, ON by default; src/ocean/
// appearance_model.hpp): every fish's 63 cosmetic floats — skin pattern and
// body shape — in a side array bound to the fish by id (Fish / AgentCore are
// unchanged). Built for a founder right after markFounder (init and the
// minPopulation reseed), for a newborn when the append gives it its id (from
// its two parents, the first being the maternal source), compacted with
// `creatures` (stable, same order) after the predator phase. Each fish's
// draws come from its own counter-based stream keyed by (world key, id), NEVER
// from `rng`: no draw is added, removed or moved, and nothing the step reads
// depends on it, so every trajectory is the one appearance-off gives. The
// world key is taken at init from a copy of the seeded engine (the copy
// advances, the engine does not). A direct structural edit of `creatures`
// (push / erase / reorder without the side array) is detected at the next
// step: the records are dropped and appearanceBroken() reports it (the shim
// then exports none); attachFounderAppearance() keeps a direct append in step.
