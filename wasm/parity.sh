# Tier-1 body model (body_model.hpp). This is a DYNAMICS knob that also ADDS TO

# survivors are reseeded founders back at 1.0. It still earns its place: 23
# insertions happen along the way (peak bodySize spread 0.92-1.09 around step
# 1000), and it exercises the body factors against predators/currents/patches
# and through the reseed path, where founders must draw NOTHING.

# body_tri_s42 exists because the other two body cases cannot see turnFactor at

# cfg.maxTurnRate, and cfg.maxTurnRate is read on the triangular-motion branch
# only — so with --tri off, bodyElong is decorative and a turn factor wired to
# the wrong parameter (or deleted outright) ships green through every other
# case here. Measured at step 2000: 193 insertions, 471 alive, 186 of them off
# the default body, bodyElong spread 0.856-1.138 — so the elongation term is
# live and varying across the population when the compare happens.

# kind of bug that is hardest to bisect after the fact — would surface here and
# nowhere else. Measured at step 2000: 55 insertions, 54 of them soft-admitted,

#   pinherit_s42  562 buds = 1124 trait draws; speedFactor 0.62-1.48 and
