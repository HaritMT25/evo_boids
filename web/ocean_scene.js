/* evo_boids 3-D Ocean: the 3D tank, deep (three.js).
 *
 * A copy of web/scene3d.js (the Classic tank) for the Ocean preview page
 * (web/ocean.html), registered as window.EvoOceanScene; to be folded back into
 * scene3d.js at E6 (PLAN_ocean_preview.md §5). What differs from scene3d.js:
 *   - the world has a real depth: s.depth (per fish), s.foodDepth, s.predDepth
 *     place everything at three Y = -depth (0 = surface .. D); without them
 *     the old hash height / fixed heights are used, as in scene3d.js
 *   - opts.tankDepth = D: the floor sits at -(D + 14), the glass box is a full
 *     box (top + bottom rectangles + verticals), marine snow falls the whole D
 *   - the camera looks more from the side (POLAR 1.0) and frames all eight
 *     corners of the box around y = -D/2; following a fish follows its depth.
 *     It is free: it orbits below the horizontal (to nearly straight up),
 *     moves in depth (moveView, and screen-plane panning from the side), and
 *     clampView keeps it out of the sand and its centre within the water.
 *     setMove (the page's W A S D, Q / E, Shift) flies it smoothly; while
 *     following a fish the same keys dolly, circle and raise the camera
 *     around the fish and the follow stays on (stepFly)
 *   - light fades and shifts blue with depth (fish, shadows, food); the floor
 *     is sand (grain, ripples) under the caustics; seen from below, the
 *     surface shows Snell's window and a shimmer (SURF_FS). setLight({on, L0,
 *     k}) (E1: the engine's light field) makes the fish / food fall-off the
 *     engine's L(d) = L0·exp(−k·d); off, the preview's linear depth / D.
 *     How much is the water's clarity (setClarity(u), drawing only; CLARITY):
 *     0 realistic, the water as the preview drew it; 1 clear (the page's
 *     default), about half the darkening, a lighter teal water above a
 *     deeper teal floor (as Classic's tank), brighter backs and ambient,
 *     softer caustics, dimmer marine snow and plankton glow, and a lift of
 *     the fish's colours outside the flashlight
 *   - each body pitches by s.vz (+ = sinking, head down), pivoting at the head
 *   - the flashlight (setFlashlight, viewer only): a cone of clear light from
 *     the camera onto the followed fish or the point it looks at; inside it
 *     the fish, food and sand show their true colours (BEAM_FN)
 *   - the appearance genome (web/ocean_appearance.js): whenever the snapshot
 *     carries s.app (oc_creature_appearance's 63 floats per fish), every fish
 *     is drawn in its own inherited body: the M1 deformable template (shape,
 *     fins, barbels), lit and fogged exactly like the plain fish, in one
 *     instanced draw (plus one for the barbels when a fish has any, and the
 *     shadow). setAppearance(on) picks its skin: on, pattern law 3 from its
 *     genes; off, its family / brain colour (s.colors) with the plain fish's
 *     darker back, pale belly and paler fins. Without s.app the plain fish
 *     mesh is drawn instead. appearanceParity() is the GPU == CPU check of
 *     the pattern law (the gallery's K12); appearancePathCheck() that of the
 *     production vertex path (the gene texture's slot lookup, every body
 *     part's position and material site, the decoded pattern genes)
 *
 * Every fish is a faceted low-poly body bent along the six spine points the
 * core exports; the floor below catches its shadow and slow caustic light.
 * Food is glowing plankton, predators are larger dark hunters whose eyes burn
 * while they hunt, and ocean currents (when the snapshot has them) show as
 * drifting streaks.
 *
 * Cost model: one instanced draw for all fish, one for their shadows, one each
 * for predators, food, currents and the floor. Per frame the CPU only packs
 * the spine points (20 floats per fish) into instance buffers; the bending,
 * shading and tail beat happen in the vertex/fragment shaders.
 *
 * World coordinates: sim (x right, y down, origin top-left) -> three
 * (X = x - W/2, Z = y - H/2, Y up = -depth).
 *
 * EvoOceanScene.load() -> Promise (imports the trimmed three bundle,
 * window.EVO_ASSETS.three); EvoOceanScene.create(canvas, opts) -> scene or null. */

   *    wander; each lies only in large patches (flat sand between, a crossing

   *    sharp crests and broad troughs
   *  - grains: up close, two jittered layers of round grains of varied size,
   *    tone and hue, a few dark specks and pale bits
   *  - light: the ripples' and grains' slopes (exact, from the noise
   *    derivatives) tilt the normal, lit from above (uLight), so they read as
   *    relief; troughs a shade darker
   *  - each detail fades out where a pixel spans a large part of its period
   *    (fwidth), so nothing aliases into lines far away or at grazing angles;
   *    far crests soften to bands, and the relief fades with distance (haze)
   * The water above tints it (uWater), then the caustics (two copies of the
